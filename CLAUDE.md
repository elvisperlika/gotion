# Gotion — Project Instructions

## What this is

Gotion is a self-hosted Notion clone: the joint deliverable for the university courses **SAP** (Software Architecture and Platforms) and **SPE** (Software Process Engineering). Both courses share this single project, so their requirements apply simultaneously and every deliverable must satisfy both.

Current state: analysis phase. The repo is a Jekyll report site (published via `gh-pages`) with one chapter per stage of the project; only Introduction and Analysis have real content, the rest are stubs. No service code yet.

## Repository conventions

The report is a set of chapter pages, each with `title` and `nav_order` front matter, rendered through `_layouts/chapter.html` (sidebar nav built automatically from `nav_order`, right-hand "on this page" from headings). Chapters, in order:

1. `introduction.md` — Deliverables, Glossary (stub)
2. `domain-model.md` — the DDD domain model (stub)
3. `analysis.md` — business requirements; pulls in `_includes/functional-requirements.md` (user stories, grouped by bounded context: Identity and Workspace, Pages and Hierarchy, Editor and Blocks, Permissions and Collaboration, Discussions/Search/Notifications) and `_includes/quality-attributes.md` (non-functional requirements as QA-xx six-part scenarios: Source → Stimulus → Artifact → Environment → Response → Response measure, grouped by category — Performance, Availability, Data Consistency, Security, Deployability, Modifiability, Accessibility)
4. `design.md` — Event Storming, Bounded Contexts, Architecture, Microservices, Patterns (stub)
5. `implementation.md` — Microservices, Testing, Multiplatform, Experiments, Monitoring (stub)
6. `devops.md` — Project Structure, VCS & Repo, Quality Assurance, CI/CD, Deployment, Benchmark (stub)
7. `conclusions.md` (stub)

Requirements now live only in `_includes/functional-requirements.md` and `_includes/quality-attributes.md` (plain Markdown, included from `analysis.md`) — there is no separate DDD/Gherkin spec anymore, and no `ddd/` or `features/` directory. Don't recreate that structure; extend the two includes instead. When a chapter's content is written, fill its existing stub headings rather than restructuring — the chapter order and headings were already agreed with the co-author.

## Architectural constraints (SAP)

- Distributed system, **microservices** architectural style.
- Each service internally follows **Clean** or **Hexagonal Architecture** (domain isolated from frameworks/IO).
- **DDD** end-to-end: domain model and bounded contexts identified before/alongside design (`domain-model.md`, `design.md`).
- Components-and-Connectors diagrams and **ADRs** go in `design.md` / a dedicated section once the first architecturally significant decision needs recording — don't scaffold it empty.
- Prototype: business logic and architectural infrastructure matter, polished UI does not.

## Process constraints (SPE)

- Demonstrable DevOps process: CI **and** CD, not just tests on push (`devops.md`).
- Automated deployment via containerization and/or orchestration.
- **At least two target platforms with different runtimes** — still an open implementation decision now that the earlier Go/Node split (implied by godog/cucumber-js tooling) is gone with `ddd/`/`features/`. Decide and record it explicitly, e.g. as an ADR, once service implementation starts.
- SPE grading weighs domain modeling and DevOps practice heavily, independent of SAP's architecture grading — don't let one slide to satisfy the other.

## Working here

- Trace every service and architectural decision back to a user story (`functional-requirements.md`) or QA scenario (`quality-attributes.md`); SPE/SAP evaluation both expect that traceability.
- When proposing a new service or bounded context, check it against QA-11 (modifiability): a change should stay confined to the block-type registry / owning service, no shared-schema migration.
